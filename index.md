## Favorite CSPC 120L Labs

* Lab 4

  This was a fun and also exciting lab for me because I did finish this alone. I walked through the process of fixing my code slowly but steadily. It wasn't hard or easy, just right for me to feel challenged.

* Lab 6, part 2

  This was my second favorite lab because it incorporated a popular game into coding. It also dealt with multiple conditions and true / false. I had a hard time trying to finish this lab and it was pretty long but it was worth it for my growth.

* Lab 7

  This was my favorite lab because it was designed to be relatable to students, parking. I parked very often when going to school or shopping, and the time permitted signs in the lab was similar to real life. It was also one part, so I thought for a while to solve it.
